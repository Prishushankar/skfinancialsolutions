# Formspree Integration Instructions

To complete the Formspree integration for your contact form, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a free account at [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)
2. Create a new form in your Formspree dashboard
3. Get your form ID (it will look something like `xyyyyyyy`)
4. Replace `YOUR_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID` in the `EmailForm.jsx` component with your actual form ID:

```jsx
const [state, handleSubmit] = useForm("YOUR_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID"); // Replace with your actual Formspree form ID
```

5. Test your form by submitting a test message
6. Check your email to confirm that you've received the test submission
7. Configure any additional settings in your Formspree dashboard, such as:
   - Email notifications
   - Response messages
   - Form security
   - Integrations with other services

That's it! Your contact form should now be fully functional with Formspree.
